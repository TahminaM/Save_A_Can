## Introduction

Welcome to Capstone Project. In this repo we will be documenting all processes we go to create a Senior Capstone Project for the School Year Spring 2023. We will be working on the Recycling App. A web app that helps you dispose of your recycling while making you money. This innovative app would take a photo as an input and using machine learning would determine if the item is recyclable and point to location in a map where that item can be recycled for money.Main features for the app are:

1. Sign Up System for users who’d like to keep track of their recycling profits. This feature will be optional as users won't be required to have an existing account in order to proceed.
2. A machine learning model capable of identifying material type of in an image.
3. Crucial information and statistics about the item properties.
4. An interactive map that would point to recycling facilities in the area.
5. A profit tracker for all users as well as a global tracker for everyone who has used the app.
